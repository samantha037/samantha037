### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Coding at Unicollege and so far I'm having a great time but meeting a few challenges, but I'm ready to give it my best shot and do my best in 
learning all that I can. So the reason I chose coding is because I found interest in how Computers were created and how the App's we are using on a daily base we also created.
I've developed a hobby in playing online video games, where I get to interact with players around the Country sometimes the world. 
I want to start creating websites for small businesses and companies to make extra cash and learn more.
